## Contents

In this repository all the data and the scripts used for the analysis are included. The data was produced using the [ARTI simulation framework](https://github.com/lagoproject/arti), which is also publicly available.

### Charge histograms

This folder contains the [raw data](charge_histograms/root), [processed data](charge_histograms/dat) and scripts to [analyze](charge_histograms/src) and produce the [charge histograms](charge_histograms/figures).

### The "total_energy_data" folder contains:

This folder contains the data corresponding to the VEM calibration histogram, the total flux detected by the WCD and the comparison between muons and other components in each site.
